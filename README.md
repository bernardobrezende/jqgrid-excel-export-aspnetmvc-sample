jqgrid-excel-export-aspnetmvc-sample
====================================

This is a small sample how to export jqGrid data to an Excel file using ASP.NET MVC 3.

Requirements to run
====================================

1) .NET Framework 4
2) ASP.NET MVC 3 RTM

Future enhancements:
====================================

1) Fix export to *.xlsx extension.
2) Remove form submission and from the "Export to Excel" button and execute an AJAX call to server.
3) Send the grid data when clicking on "Export to Excel". Current version calls (again) the query in export action.
